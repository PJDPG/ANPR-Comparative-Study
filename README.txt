This repository has been created for any programmer who is looking for alternatives of AI based ANPR systems, such as Template matching or traditional methods. 

The reopository contains:
-License plate detection systems:
	-Traditional methods
	-AI(YoloV8)
-OCR algorithms:
	-Template matching
	-AI(YoloV8)

All code has been commented in spanish. 

All code is from my undergrad thesis called "Estudio y desarrollo de soluci√≥n ANPR para acceso vehicular", published by Universidad Europea de Madrid. Using these key words you can find and read the full thesis with all engeneering decisions and annotations.

Good luck!
